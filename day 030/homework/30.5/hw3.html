    <p>Instructions:
        Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C Fan/Gas 4). Grease and line two 20cm/8in sandwich tins.
        
        In a large mixing bowl, combine all cake ingredients except the boiling water. Beat until smooth.
        
        Gradually add the boiling water, mixing until smooth. The batter will be quite liquid.
        
        Divide the batter between the tins and bake for 25–35 minutes, or until a skewer inserted comes out clean.
        
        Let the cakes cool completely before icing.
        
        Chocolate Ganache:
        200g plain chocolate
        
        200ml double cream
        
        Heat the chocolate and cream in a saucepan over low heat until melted.
        
        Remove from heat and whisk until smooth and thickened.
        
        Let it cool for 1–2 hours until spreadable.
        
        Assembly:
        Spread ganache over one cake layer, then place the second layer on top.
        
        Cover the entire cake with ganache using a palette knife.
        
        Enjoy your rich, moist chocolate cake!</p>

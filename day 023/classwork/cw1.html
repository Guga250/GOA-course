            <p>Salad recipes are my favorite way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce—fruits and veggies that taste so good on their own that it doesn’t take much to make them into a delicious meal. On cold winter nights, I like to brighten up our table with a colorful mix of root veggies and hearty greens. On beautiful, warm days when I’d rather be outside than in the kitchen, summer salads are the perfect lunch or dinner: they’re simple to toss together, but they’re super flavorful nonetheless.
             Whether you want to add more plant-based meals to your diet or are simply looking to change up your salad game, you'll find tons of inspiration in the salad recipes below. With everything from green salads to pasta salads and more, these recipes are perfect for passing at potlucks, serving as dinner side dishes, and enjoying as full meals on their own.</p>
